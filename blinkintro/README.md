Blink Intro
===========

Makes use of the sound channels energy, mapping it over a color palette
which translates to a flashing or blinking effect on the screen. Foreground
and background colors are cycled, inverted to each other.

Also, the floppy disk drive LED is made to blink from the audio.

**WARNING: This is pure seizure stuff. Flashing lights!!** Be careful if you
assemble and run this.
